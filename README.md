# ImageSearchApp_Project
🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 🚀

I’ve been diving into JavaScript recently and created an Image Search App as part of my learning journey. 📸✨ This project helped me improve my skills in:

JavaScript functions and event handling
API integration
User interaction and UI/UX development
🔍 What the app does: It allows users to search for images based on keywords, fetching data from an external API to display relevant results.

👨‍💻 Tech used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and an external image search API.

Building this app was a great experience, and I'm excited to continue growing my skills in web development. Feel free to check it out and share your thoughts!
